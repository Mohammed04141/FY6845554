    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
    <p>This Article delves into the dynamic intersection of two cutting edge technologies – Nanotechnology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) – and their profound implications for reshaping the world as we know it. As Nanotech continues to miniaturise the physical realm, and AI augments the intellectual capabilities of machines, their convergence opens unprecedented possibilities and challenges. From revolutionary advancements in healthcare, energy, and materials science to the ethical considerations surrounding anatomy and decision-making, this exploration navigates the multifaceted impact of Nanotech and AI on our interconnected global society. Through a lens of innovation, ethics, and societal adaptation, we unravel the intricate tapestry that these technologies weave, offering a glimpse into the transformative journey that awaits us in the era of Nanotech and AI integration.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and Nanotechnology are two of the most rapidly developing technologies in the world. AI is the ability of machines to simulate human intelligence, while nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter at the atomic and molecular level. These two technologies are already having a profound impact on our lives, and they are only going to become more important in the future. </p>
    <p>Regarding Nanotechnology, Feynman once described a vision of using machines to build smaller machines down to the molecular level <a href="#bibliography">(Bayda et al., 2019)</a>. This idea if put into practice could allow us infinite ways to further the development of mankind in every sense from physical health to architecture. </p>
    <p>AI has made monumental changes to the way we work especially in recent years. Especially with AI engines like ChatGPT and Google Bard, we’ve had to adapt to the risks involved with AI as openly available as it has become. Where students can, instead of writing up a 1000-word essay, have a bot do it for them in seconds. This gives examiners and teachers a much harder time with checking if a students work I truly their own. </p>

    <h2 id="main-body">Potential Uses</h2>
    <p>With AI, we’ve had to change the way we see and deal with it in our lives. With monumental changes to how we live, some people even using it as opposed to traditional search engines. Combine this power of an alternate mind working where we don’t have to, with the versatility of nanomachines, this would bring countless improvements to a vast range of applications. From targeted medication to countering climate change. When paired with Nanotechnology, this could potentially revolutionize almost every sector.</p>
    <h3 id="Climate">Climate Change</h3>
    <p>The battle against climate change necessitates innovative approaches to electricity generation and utilization, and nanotechnology has already emerged as a pivotal contributor. It has been instrumental in the development of batteries with enhanced energy storage capacities for electric vehicles and has empowered solar panels to more efficiently convert sunlight into electricity.</p>
    <p>The common trick in both applications is to use nanotexturing or nanomaterials (Prodromakis, Reader in Nanoelectronics, 2022). This involves transforming a flat surface into a three-dimensional structure, significantly increasing the surface area. This expansion provides more room for the reactions responsible for energy storage or generation, enhancing the efficiency of the devices. This can be done by employing materials like nanowires and/or carbon nanotubes (White, Black plastic can't be recycled – but we've just found a way to use the carbon in renewable energy, 2023). The main issue with carbon however is that Exposure to carbon nanotubes has been linked to mesothelioma, a lung lining cancer. Inhaling nanotubes is thought to cause lung tissue scarring akin to asbestos fibres. This raises concerns as nanotubes are already present in various everyday items like bicycle frames, car bodies, and tennis rackets (Ren, Carbon nanotube 2023). Guoqiang highlights this as a main concern in terms of carbon nanotubes and potential poisoning is a main concern for the future of nanotechnology. The manufacture of nanomachines and other nanotechnologies would naturally be tedious with a high margin for error, this should be considered. The cost to make these machines would be extreme and even though they are extremely beneficial, it would be incredibly difficult at the current state of technology to reuse these machines.</p>
    <p>Overall, nanomachines would allow us to use, store and gather energy as each machine would only use a minuscule amount of it more efficiently. Pairing it with the newfound breakthroughs in AI, we can create almost fully autonomous machines that can change their shape, size, and application in conjunction with countless others, making them extremely diverse.</p>
